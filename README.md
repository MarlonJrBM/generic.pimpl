# generic.pimpl

This is a very simple implementation of a generic pimpl class.

Pimpl is a C++ idiom which avoids compile-time dependencies. It closely resembles the bridge design pattern.

In order to use this, one must include the *pimpl.hh* header and use it as demonstrated in *MyClass.hh*. 

This implementation is largely inspired by one of the C++ heroes, [Herb Sutter](https://herbsutter.com/gotw/_100/).
